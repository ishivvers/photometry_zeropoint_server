This is a draft framework for a photometry zeropoint server
which takes in a list of object coordinates and a requested
band and returns a list of magnitudes.


METHOD:
+ query SDSS, NOMAD for observations of object
+ match found observations to best set of observations from 
  synthetic photometry of modeled stars
+ return requested passbands, either from query or from best-fit model



CURRENT STATE:
- full_query(coordinates_list) returns:
   if in SDSS: griz + modeled Y (model fit to SDSS)
   if not in SDSS: modeled grizY (model fit to NOMAD)
- run test_model_fits() to examine some of these


QUICK EXAMPLE:
for a quick comparison of best-fit models (to NOMAD photometry)
and SDSS observations, run:
> from find_photometry import *
> test_model_fits()
 *** and, for normal use ***
> query_locations = np.load( open('matches.npy','r'))
> print full_query( query_locations )
