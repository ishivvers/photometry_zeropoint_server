This is a draft framework for a photometry zeropoint server
which would take in a list of object coordinates and a requested
band and return a list of magnitudes.

CURRENT STATE:
- returns ugriz magnitudes from SDSS query
- if object not in SDSS, returns magnitudes as
   interpolated from NOMAD magnitudes

The main problem is determining SDSS mags from NOMAD mags.
It seems like the fluxes determined from NOMAD magnitudes and the fluxes
 determined from SDSS magnitudes are strongly at odds.

Right now I use simple mag-to-flux and flux-to-mag conversions - that's probably
 where the dominant errors come in, but I don't think using the true filter function
 can solve these 1-mag offsets.

Would like to check in and discuss how to solve this; there seem
 to be significant corrections needed that I don't really know (reddening)?


QUICK EXAMPLE:
run, in python:
> import find_photometry
> find_photometry.test_interpolation()

there are two sources in the test_interpolation function; simply swap the comments to explore the other.
