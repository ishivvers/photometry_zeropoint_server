This is a draft framework for a photometric zeropoint server.
Currently, it produces a catalog of magnitudes 
 for all sources in SDSS or 2MASS+USNOB1, including
 u,g,r,i,z,y,B,R,J,H,K photometry, using a combination
 of the cataloged magnitudes and synthetic photometry.

REQUIRES commmand line tools findsdss8, find2mass, findusnob1
 - available from http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/doc/cdsclient.html

EXAMPLES:
first import everything, e.g.:
> from get_SEDs import *

To produce a catalog of all objects possible in a field, run:
> catalog( (314.136483, -6.081352), 900., savefile='catalog.txt' )
*** catalog of objects in a 1/4 degree (900") field centered at 314.136483, -6.081352 ***
*** can run anywhere in the sky, in or out of SDSS footprint ***

To view the SED of any single source, with model compared to observations:
> show_SED( 314.136483, -6.081352 )
*** other examples:
    # USNOB1+2MASS
    75.005564, 49.999882
    75.032986, 49.988026
    # SDSS+2MASS
    199.899058, 49.766365
    199.712023, 49.902397
*** or any coordinate pair found by catalog()

To analyze the errors accrued for determining z-band photometry
by fitting a model to USNOB1+2MASS or SDSS+2MASS (except for z),
run:
> test_z_errors( 220., 50., size=900. )
*** this analyzes errors for objects in a 900" box around 220., 50.
*** can run on any field in SDSS footprint
	

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
to do:

Compare this output catalog with one produced by sextractor,
 and report instrumental zeropoint for relevant band.
Compare results with results from standard-star observations.
