This is a draft framework for a photometric zeropoint server.
Currently, it produces a catalog of magnitudes 
 for all sources in SDSS or 2MASS+USNOB1, including
 u,g,r,i,z,y,B,R,J,H,K photometry, using a combination
 of the cataloged magnitudes and synthetic photometry.

EXAMPLEs:

to view the SED of an object as determined by fits to BRJHK photometry,
 compared to the full SED including ugrizy photometry, run:
> from get_SEDs import *
> test_sdss_interp( 314.136483, -6.081352 )
*** shows modeled SED (without including SDSS mags) compared to true ***
> construct_SED( 314.136483, -6.081352 )
*** to view other sources, input the 2MASS coordinates of another object
    present in all three catalogs ***

to produce a catalog of all objects possible in a field, run:
> from get_SEDs import *
> catalog( (314.136483, -6.081352), 1800., savefile='catalog.txt' )
*** catalog of objects in a 1/2 degree field centered at 314.136483, -6.081352 ***

to do:

Build system to compare this output catalog with one produced
 by sextractor, and report zeropoint difference for relevant band.
Compare results with results from standard-star observations.
